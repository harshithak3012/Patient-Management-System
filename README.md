This code implements a basic Patient Management System using a priority queue in C. Here's a brief explanation of its functionality and structure:

Structures:

details: Represents the details of a patient including their name, age, and ID.
Patient: Represents a node in the patient queue containing a patient's details along with a priority value and a pointer to the next patient.
PatientQueue: Represents the patient queue with a pointer to the front of the queue.
Functions:

createPatient(): Creates a new patient node with provided details and priority.
createQueue(): Creates a new empty patient queue.
isEmpty(): Checks if the patient queue is empty.
enqueue(): Inserts a new patient into the queue based on their priority.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the highest priority patient from the queue.
displayQueue(): Displays the patients in the queue along with their details and priority.
Main Function:

Presents a menu-driven interface allowing users to perform various operations on the patient queue.
Options include registering a new patient with their details and priority, processing the next patient with the highest priority, displaying the patient queue, and exiting the program.
Functionality:

Registering Patient: Allows users to input patient details and priority, and registers them into the queue according to their priority.
Processing Next Patient: Removes and displays the patient with the highest priority from the queue.
Displaying Patient Queue: Shows all patients currently in the queue along with their details and priority.
Exiting Program: Terminates the program.
Overall, this code provides a simple yet effective system for managing patients, ensuring that patients with higher priority are processed first. It's useful in scenarios where patients need to be managed based on their urgency or severity of condition, such as in hospital emergency departments or medical clinics.
